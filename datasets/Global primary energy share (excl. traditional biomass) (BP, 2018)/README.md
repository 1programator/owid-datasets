# Global primary energy share (excl. traditional biomass) (BP, 2018)

Global share of primary energy consumption by source, calculated by Our World in Data based on absolute energy consumption figures from BP Statistical Review of World Energy (2018).

Data represents primary energy (rather than final energy) consumption. 'Other renewables' represents all renewable sources minus solar, wind, and hydropower (e.g. geothermal, wave and tidal, and modern biofuels).

Shares of primary energy consumption are based on the exclusion of traditional biomass.
