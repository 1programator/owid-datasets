# Fertility rate (Gapminder, v12) (2018)

Data is that of version 12 of Gapminder, the latest version as of 2019. This is the full fertility rate dataset published by Gapminder.

Gapminder's sources and methodology if well-documented in its dataset at: https://www.gapminder.org/data/

It notes its data sources during three key periods of time:

— 1800 to 1950 (and in some cases also years after 1950): Gapminder v6 which were compiled and documented by Mattias Lindgren.

— 1950 to 2014: In most cases we use the latest UN estimates from World Population Prospects 2017 published in the file with Annually interpolated demographic indicators, called WPP2017_INT_F01_ANNUAL_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS.xlsx , accessed on September 2, 2017.

— 2015 – 2099: We use the UN forecast of future fertility rate in all countries, called median fertility variant.
