GSMA's definition of mobile money:
- A mobile money service includes transferring money and making payments using the mobile phone. 
- The service must be available to the unbanked, e.g. people who do not have access to a formal account at a financial institution.
- The service must offer a network of physical transactional points which can include agents, outside of bank branches and ATMs, that make the service widely accessible to everyone.
- Mobile banking or payment services (such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet) that offer the mobile phone as just another channel to access a traditional banking product are not included.
