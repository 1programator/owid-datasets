# Endangered Species - IUCN (2019)

This dataset presents figures on the numbers of described species, assessed species, and threatened species, and the best estimated percentage of threatened species, by major groups of organisms (2000â€“2019), according to the IUCN Red List.

Extinction risk has been assessed for about 5% of the world's described species, and so this dataset should not be interpreted as a full and complete assessment of the world's biodiversity. Assessment efforts have focused on those species that are likely to be threatened; therefore any percentage of threatened species reported for these groups would be heavily biased (i.e., the % threatened species would likely be an overestimate).

Species assessed as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), or Vulnerable (VU) are referred to as "threatened" species.
