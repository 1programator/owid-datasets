# Endangered Species - IUCN (2019)

This dataset presents figures on the numbers of described species, assessed species, and threatened species, and the best estimate of the percentage of threatened species, by major groups of organisms (2000â€“2019), according to the IUCN Red List.

Total described species is the number of distinct species identified by various scientific sources, which are shown here: https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/2019_2_RL_Table_1a_v2.pdf. These figures should be used with extreme care as these are not the currently accepted totals for all taxonomic groups.

Total assessed species is the number of species that have undergone an extinction risk assessment. Extinction risk has been assessed for about 5% of the world's described species, and so this dataset should not be interpreted as a full and complete assessment of the world's biodiversity. Assessment efforts have focused on those species that are likely to be threatened; therefore any percentage of threatened species reported for these groups would be heavily biased (i.e., the % threatened species would likely be an overestimate).

Total threatened species is the number of species assessed as "critically endangered", "endangered", or "vulnerable", according to the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, which are generally based on the population size and geographic range: https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/RL-2001-001-2nd.pdf

Estimated threatened species is the estimated percentage of species that are threatened. The proportion of threatened species is only reported for the more completely evaluated groups (i.e., >80% of species have been evaluated). This figure is presented as a best estimate, defined as the percentage of threatened extant species if data deficient species are equally threatened as data sufficient species.
