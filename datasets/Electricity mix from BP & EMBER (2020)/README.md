# Electricity mix from BP & EMBER (2020)

Data is compiled by Our World in Data based on two sources: 
– BP Statistical Review of World Energy: https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html
– Ember: https://ember-climate.org/data/

We rely on electricity mix data from BP as our primary source for two key reasons: BP also provides total energy (not just electricity) consumption data, meaning energy and electricity data is consistent from the same source; and it provides a longer time-series (dating back to 1965) versus only 2000 from Ember.

However, BP does not provide data for all countries. So, where data from BP is available for a given country or year, we rely on it as the primary source. But we supplement this with data from Ember where it's not available.

Ember compiles electricity mix data from numerous international and national sources, but relies on the Energy Information Administration (EIA) as its primary source.

Our World in Data has converted absolute electricity production by source to the share in the mix by dividing each by the total electricity production.
