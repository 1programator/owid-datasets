So, where data from BP is available for a given country or year, we rely on it as the primary source. But we supplement this with data from Ember where it's not available.\n\nEmber compiles electricity mix data from numerous international and national sources, but relies on the Energy Information Administration (EIA) as its primary source.\n\nOur World in Data has converted absolute electricity production by source to the share in the mix by dividing each by the total electricity production.",
