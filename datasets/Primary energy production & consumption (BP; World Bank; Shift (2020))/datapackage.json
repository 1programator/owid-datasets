  "description": "Primary energy consumption data was compiled by Our World in Data based on two key data sources: \n1. BP Statistical Review of World Energy: https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html\n2. World Bank, World Development Indicators: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators\n\nBP provides the longest and most up-to-date time-series of primary energy. However, it does provide data for all countries. We have therefore supplemented this dataset with energy data from the World Bank, World Development Indicators. Where BP provides data for a given country, this data is adopted; for countries where this data is missing, we rely on World Bank figures.\n\nPrimary energy production data was sourced from the Shift Project. The Shift Project draws on two sources: \n– Etemad & Luciani for the period 1900-1980 Bouda Etemad and Jean Luciani, World Energy Production 1900 – 1985, ISBN 2-600-56007-6, Data digitalized and published with agreement of B. Etemad\n– US EIA Historical Statistics for 1980-2016. U.S. Energy Information Administration\n\nTo convert from total primary energy to per capita figures (or vice versa), we use population figures from the UN World Population Prospects: https://population.un.org/wpp/.\n\nTo calculate energy per unit of GDP, we use total real GDP figures from the Maddison Project Database (2018): http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm. This is measured in 2011$ which are PPP-adjusted.\n\n",
