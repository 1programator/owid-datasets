# CO2 mitigation curves for 1.5C (Andrews & GCP, 2019)

Data marks the range of CO2 mitigation curves for a range of 'peak scenarios': scenarios are based on the necessary annual emission curves necessary if emissions were to peak in a given year. 

For example, 'Peak in 2010' marks the necessary future emissions pathway to have a >66% chance of keeping global average temperatures below 1.5C warming if global CO2 emissions had peaked in 2010.

Historical emissions to 2017 are sourced from CDIAC/Global Carbon Project, projection to 2018 from Global Carbon Project (Le Quéré et al. 2018).

Global cumulative CO2 emissions budgets are from the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C (Rogelj et al 2018): 420 GtCO2 for a 66% of 1.5°C and 1170 GtCO2 for a 66% of 2°C. Mitigation curves describe approximately exponential decay pathways such that the quota is never exceeded (see Raupach et al., 2014).
