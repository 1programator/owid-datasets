  "description": "OxCGRT collects publicly available information on indicators of government response. These indicators take policies such as school closures, travel bans, etc. and record them on an ordinal scale; the remainder are financial indicators such as fiscal or monetary measures.\n\nOxCGRT measures the variation in governments’ responses using its 'COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index (Stringency Index)'. This composite measure is a simple additive score of nine indicators measured on an ordinal scale, rescaled to vary from 0 to 100. Please note that this measure is for comparative purposes only, and should not necessarily be interpreted as a rating of the appropriateness or effectiveness of a country's response.\n\nNote: \nThis is an ongoing collation project of live data. If you see any inaccuracies in the underlying data please contact us on the feedback form below. The underlying index is evolving as the situation and data evolves from country to country, and will change over time as the data gets more accurate.\n\nThe specific policy and response categories are coded as follows:\n\nSchool closures:\n0 - No measures\n1 - recommend closing\n2 - Require closing (only some levels or categories,\neg just high school, or just public schools)\n3 - Require closing all levels\nNo data - blank\n\nWorkplace closures:\n0 - No measures\n1 - recommend closing (or work from home)\n2 - require closing (or work from home) for some\nsectors or categories of workers\n3 - require closing (or work from home) all but essential workplaces (eg grocery stores, doctors)\nNo data - blank\n\nCancel public events:\n0- No measures\n1 - Recommend cancelling\n2 - Require cancelling\nNo data - blank\n\nRestrictions on gatherings:\n0 - No restrictions\n1 - Restrictions on very large gatherings (the limit is above 1000 people)\n2 - Restrictions on gatherings between 100-1000 people\n3 - Restrictions on gatherings between 10-100 people\n4 - Restrictions on gatherings of less than 10 people\nNo data - blank\n\nClose public transport:\n0 - No measures\n1 - Recommend closing (or significantly reduce volume/route/means of transport available)\n2 - Require closing (or prohibit most citizens from using it)\n\nPublic information campaigns:\n0 -No COVID-19 public information campaign\n1 - public officials urging caution about COVID-19\n2 - coordinated public information campaign (e.g. across traditional and social media)\nNo data - blank\n\nStay at home:\n0 - No measures\n1 - recommend not leaving house\n2 - require not leaving house with exceptions for daily exercise, grocery shopping, and ‘essential’ trips\n3 - Require not leaving house with minimal exceptions (e.g. allowed to leave only once every few days, or only one person can leave at a time, etc.)\nNo data - blank\n\nRestrictions on internal movement:\n0 - No measures\n1 - Recommend movement restriction\n2 - Restrict movement\n\nInternational travel controls:\n0 - No measures\n1 - Screening\n2 - Quarantine arrivals from high-risk regions\n3 - Ban on high-risk regions\n4 - Total border closure\nNo data - blank\n\nTesting policy\n0 – No testing policy\n1 – Only those who both (a) have symptoms AND (b) meet specific criteria (eg key workers, admitted to hospital, came into contact with a known case, returned from overseas)\n2 – testing of anyone showing COVID-19 symptoms\n3 – open public testing (eg “drive through” testing available to asymptomatic people)\nNo data\n\nContract tracing\n0 - No contact tracing\n1 - Limited contact tracing - not done for all cases\n2 - Comprehensive contact tracing - done for all cases\nNo data",
