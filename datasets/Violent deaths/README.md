# Violent deaths

This dataset presents estimates of the levels of violence in modern and prehistoric state and non-state societies, based on archaeological and ethnographic evidence.

For modern state societies, homicide rates are routinely published by statistical offices or other state agencies, and research institutes publish reliable data on war deaths.

For the study of lethal violence in non-state societies, we have generally two different sources of information: for the more recent past (since the late 19th century), abundant ethnographic evidence is available; for the more distant past, we have information on the prevalence of violence from archaeologists who have studied violence in past societies by studying archaeological sites and skeletal remains. 
They present data on the share of people that died in violent conflict with other humans in scientific studies.
