This is the full fertility rate dataset published by Gapminder.\n\nGapminder's sources and methodology if well-documented in its dataset at: https://www.gapminder.org/data/\n\nIt notes its data sources during three key periods of time:\n\n— 1800 to 1950 (and in some cases also years after 1950): Gapminder v6 which were compiled and documented by Mattias Lindgren.\n\n— 1950 to 2014: In most cases we use the latest UN estimates from World Population Prospects 2017 published in the file with Annually interpolated demographic indicators, called WPP2017_INT_F01_ANNUAL_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS.xlsx , accessed on September 2, 2017.\n\n— 2015 – 2099: We use the UN forecast of future fertility rate in all countries, called median fertility variant.\n\nVersion 12 of the dataset extends back to the year 1800. Version 6 of Gapminder's fertility series includes data for a few countries further than 1800. We have included more historic data from Version 6 for Finland, the United Kingdom and Sweden. All data from 1800 onwards is from Version 12; data from pre-1800 is from Version 6.",
