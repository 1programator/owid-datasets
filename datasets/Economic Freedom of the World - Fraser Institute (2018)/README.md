# Economic Freedom of the World - Fraser Institute (2018)

The cornerstones of economic freedom are (1) personal choice, (2) voluntary exchange coordinated by markets, (3) freedom to enter and compete in markets, and (4) protection of persons and their property from aggression by others.

Economic freedom is present when individuals are permitted to choose for themselves and engage in voluntary transactions as long as they do not harm the person or property of others.

Economic freedom scoring is measured from 0 to 10 where 10 represents the maximum economic freedom, and 0 no economic freedom.
