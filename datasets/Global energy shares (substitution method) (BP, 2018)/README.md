# Global energy shares (substitution method) (BP, 2018)

The share of global energy consumption, based on the 'substitution method' of energy accounting. The 'substitution method' attempts to correct for the inefficiencies in thermal (fossil) energy production by applying a correction factor for this inefficiency.

The 'substitution method' provides an approximation (although not perfect fit) to final energy demand. In the progression towards a low-carbon energy system, the substitution method provides a helpful overview of the approximate final energy demand which would be required by low-carbon sources.

BP factors into its reporting an efficiency correction factor of 0.38 for thermal energy sources. Calculating energy shares from all sources in their Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) from BP provides an approximation of the substitution method.

Note that applying a single conversion factor introduces some uncertainty since the appropriate conversion will vary by specific fuel type and region. However, for analysis of the global energy outlook, it provides a good approximation.

Here, 'other renewables' includes all renewable sources minus solar, wind, hydropower and traditional biomass. Traditional biomass has been excluded from these calculations. 'Low carbon' sources is the sum of total renewables and nuclear energy. 'Fossil fuels' is the sum of coal, crude oil and natural gas.
