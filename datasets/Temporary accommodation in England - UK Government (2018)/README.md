# Temporary accommodation in England - UK Government (2018)

Figures report the number of households, households with children and number of children in 'temporary accommodation' (TA).

Temporary accommodation (typically given for a period of 28 days or less) is allocated to households without permanent housing, and are therefore included in annual homelessness accounts. Temporary accommodation includes relocation to bed and breakfasts, hostels, shelters, local authority or privately-owned temporary accommodation.
