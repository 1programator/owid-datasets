# Numbers and Shares of Each Political Regime — V-Dem (2019)

For each year 1900–2018, the V-Dem Project's variable "Regimes of the world – the RoW measure (D) (v2x_regime)" (version 9, 2019) classifies each country as one of four possible regimes:

0. Closed autocracy
1. Electoral autocracy
2. Electoral democracy
3. Liberal democracy

(For how they did this classification, see p. 254 of their "V-Dem Cookbook v9".)

This dataset was produced entirely from the above classification and contains 13 variables. These variables simply count, for each year 1900–2018, the number and share of each of the four regimes and combinations thereof.
