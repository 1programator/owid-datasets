# Fossil fuel vs. low-carbon primary energy shares (OWID based on BP, 2018)

The share of global primary energy produced from fossil fuel versus low-carbon sources based on BP Statistical Review data. This is based on each source's share of primary energy demand in terrawatt-hours. Our World in Data have converted fossil fuel sources (reported in million tonnes of oil equivalent) to TWh using a conversion factor of 11.63.

These shares do not include traditional biomass.

- 'Fossil fuels' is equal to the sum of global coal, natural gas and crude oil consumption.
- 'Renewables' is equal to the sum of solar, wind, hydropower and 'other renewables' (which is the sum of other renewable sources including geothermal, modern biofuels, wind and tidal). 
- 'Low-carbon' is the sum of renewable and nuclear energy consumption.
