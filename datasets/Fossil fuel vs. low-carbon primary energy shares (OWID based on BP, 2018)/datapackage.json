This is based on each source's share of primary energy demand in terrawatt-hours. Our World in Data have converted fossil fuel sources (reported in million tonnes of oil equivalent) to TWh using a conversion factor of 11.63.\n\nThese shares do not include traditional biomass.\n\n- 'Fossil fuels' is equal to the sum of global coal, natural gas and crude oil consumption.\n- 'Renewables' is equal to the sum of solar, wind, hydropower and 'other renewables' (which is the sum of other renewable sources including geothermal, modern biofuels, wind and tidal). \n- 'Low-carbon' is the sum of renewable and nuclear energy consumption.",
