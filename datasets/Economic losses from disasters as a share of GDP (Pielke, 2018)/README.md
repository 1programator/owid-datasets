# Economic losses from disasters as a share of GDP (Pielke, 2018)

Data represents absolute global economic losses from disasters (total and weather-related) in 2017 US$ from two sources: Munich Re and Aon Benfield. Data from these sources has been cross-checked with data from the EMDAT database (http://www.emdat.be/). The former two sources in general report slightly higher economic losses relative to EMDAT.

This has been normalized to economic losses from disasters as a share of global gross domestic product (GDP) based on global GDP data derived from the World Bank.
