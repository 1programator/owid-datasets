Supplemental data of Global Carbon Budget 2020 (Version 1.0) [Data set]. Global Carbon Project. https://doi.org/10.18160/gcp-2020\n\nThe full CO2 emissions dataset from the Global Carbon Project has been provided by Dr Robbie Andrew: https://folk.universitetetioslo.no/roberan/GCB2020.shtml\n\nData has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.\n\n\"Statistical differences\" are referred to by the Global Carbon Project as the difference between global emissions and the sum of all national emissions plus bunker fuels: this discrepancy is therefore categorized as \"statistical differences\".\n\nOur World in Data have renamed the category \"bunker fuels\" as \"International transport\" which includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. We have renamed this category for clarity.\n\nEach country and region's share of global carbon dioxide (CO₂) has been calculated by Our World in Data based on annual national emissions data published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP). This is calculated as each country's share of the sum of all country emissions plus international aviation and shipping ('bunkers') and 'statistical differences'.\n\nConsumption-based emissions are national or regional emissions which have been adjusted for trade (i.e. territorial/production emissions minus emissions embedded in exports, plus emissions embedded in imports). If a country's consumption-based emissions are higher than its production emissions it is a net importer of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe underlying source is an updated version of the paper by \"Peters et al. (2011). Growth in emission transfers via international trade from 1990 to 2008.\" This updated data is available in the latest version of the Global Carbon Budget. \n\nOur World in Data has calculated several additional metrics based on the following metrics:\n– Energy consumption data from BP Statistical Review of World Energy: https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html\n– Long-term GDP data from Maddison Project Database: https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2018\n– Population data from the UN World Population Prospects and Gapminder.\nhttps://www.gapminder.org/\nhttps://population.un.org/wpp/\n\nFull reference for the CO2 emissions data from the Global Carbon Project: \nFriedlingstein, Pierre, O'Sullivan, Michael, Jones, Matthew W., Andrew, Robbie M., Hauck, Judith, Olsen, Are, Peters, Glen P., Peters, Wouter, Pongratz, Julia, Sitch, Stephen, Le Quéré, Corinne, Canadell, Josep G., Ciais, Philippe, Jackson, Robert B., Alin, Simone, Aragão, Luiz E.
