# Deaths per TWh energy production, all sources (Markandya & Wilkinson; Sovacool et al.)

Death rates from energy production is measured as the number of deaths by energy source per terawatt-hour (TWh) of production. 

This data combines two sources: Markandya, A., & Wilkinson, P. (2007) assessed the death rates from accidents and air pollution major energy sources (fossil fuels, nuclear and biomass). Sovacool et al. (2016) assessed death rates from accidents from low-carbon energy sources (nuclear and renewables) based on historical records spanning the period 1990 to 2013.

The analysis from Markandya & Wilkinson (2007) was published before the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. Sovacool et al. (2016) only consider deaths from 1990 onwards and therefore do not include the Chernobyl disaster. So, to include both major nuclear incidents Our World in Data has calculated the nuclear death rate based on the following assumptions:
– a long-term death toll of 4000 from the Chernobyl disaster: this is based on WHO estimate from its 2005/06 assessment ‘Chernobyl’s Legacy: Health, Environmental and Socio-Economic Impacts’: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2005/pr38/en/
– a death toll of 574 from Fukushima. No one died directly from the Fukushima disaster. In 2018, the Japanese government reported that one worker has since died from lung cancer as a result of exposure from the event. The official death toll was 573 people – who died as a result of evacuation procedures and stress-induced factors.
– Using BP global energy data on nuclear energy production from 1965 to 2019, we can convert these death figures to a death rate.
– Markandya & Wilkinson (2007) estimated occupational deaths (most from milling and mining) at a rate of 0.021 deaths per TWh. We have added this to the death toll from accidents above.

The final figure of 0.07 deaths per TWh calculated by Our World in Data works out to be the same as the rate reported by Markandya & Wilkinson (2007).
