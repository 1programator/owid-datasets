# GDP growth from previous year, 2020 Q2 (Eurostat and OECD)

We combined data on year on year GDP growth by quarter from two sources:

1) The Eurostat 'flash estimates' for GDP, as released in the euroindicators news release (125/2020) on 14 August 2020

2) OECD's quarterly national accounts data, available at OECD.stat.

In both cases, the data relates to the percentage change in GDP compared with the same quarter of the previous year (Q2 2019). This is calculated using a volume measure of GDP and as such, is adjusted to account for inflation between the years. The data is also seasonally adjusted.
