# Excess Mortality Data – HMD (2020)

Data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) Short-term Mortality Fluctuations project for all countries except the UK (HMD has data for England & Wales, Scotland, and N. Ireland but not the UK as a whole). UK data sourced from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS).

We used the raw weekly death data from HMD to calculate P-scores. The P-score is the percentage difference between the number of weekly deaths in 2020 and the average number of deaths in the same week over the years 2015–2019. For the UK P-scores were calculated by the ONS.

We do not show the most recent weeks of each country’s data series. This exclusion of data varies from one to four weeks. The decision about how many weeks to exclude is made individually for each country based on when its death reports are at least 80% complete. This is based on national estimates of delays in death reporting (when available) and our own study of the 2020 data. For a detailed list of the data we exclude for each country and the evidence and reasoning on which we base our decision, see this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z_mnVOvI9GVLiJRG1_3ond-Vs1GTseHVv1w-pF2o6Bs/edit?usp=sharing.
