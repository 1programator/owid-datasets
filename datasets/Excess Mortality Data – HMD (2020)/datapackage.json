  "description": "Data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) Short-term Mortality Fluctuations project for all countries except the UK (HMD has data for England & Wales, Scotland, and N. Ireland but not the UK as a whole). UK data sourced from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nWe used the raw weekly death data from HMD to calculate P-scores. The P-score is the percentage difference between the number of weekly deaths in 2020 and the average number of deaths in the same week over the years 2015–2019. For the UK P-scores were calculated by the ONS.\n\nWe do not show data from the most recent 1–4 weeks of each country's data series because these weeks are likely to be incomplete due to delays in death reporting. The decision about how many weeks to exclude is made separately for each country to only show data that is at least 80% complete, based on studies of delays in death reporting.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the HMD data, including week date definitions, the coverage (of individuals, locations, and time), whether dates are for death occurrence or registration, the original national source information, and important caveats, see the HMD metadata file at https://www.mortality.org/Public/STMF_DOC/STMFmetadata.pdf.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the UK ONS data, see the full report at https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/januarytojune2020.",
