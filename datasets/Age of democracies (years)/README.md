# Age of democracies (years)

Boix, Miller, and Rosato (2012, "A Complete Data Set of Political Regimes, 1800–2007", Comparative Political Studies) code each country as being either a democracy or not in each year 1800–2015 (we use the March 2018 Version 3.0 of their data). We can then compute the age of each existing democracy in 2015.

Example 1: Canada "149" means that Canada has been a democracy for the 149 years through 2015 (i.e. 1867–2015).

Example 2: China "0" means that China was not a democracy in 2015.

Boix, Miller, and Rosato (2012) "define a country as democratic if it meets the following conditions for both contestation and participation:

"Contestation

"1. The executive is directly or indirectly elected in popular elections and is responsible either directly to voters or to a legislature.

"2. The legislature (or the executive if elected directly) is chosen in free and fair elections.
Participation

"3. A majority of adult men has the right to vote.

"To code country-years, we rely on a variety of sources ..."

Note: The oldest democracy (the US) is listed as having been 216 years old at the end of 2015, but that is only because Boix, Miller, and Rosato's data set goes back to 1800. It would be more correct to state that democracy in the US is *at least* 216 years old.
