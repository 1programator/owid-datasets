# Conflict deaths â€“ UCDP Georeferenced Event Data (2019)

UCDP (GED) v19.1 provides estimates for direct conflict deaths (i.e. excluding indirect deaths from disease, malnutrition, exposure etc.) of both civilians and military personnel occurring in individual geo-referenced events. Taking the 'best' deaths estimates, we have aggregated these to country-year observations.

UCDP documentation makes it clear that the dataset is intended to have global coverage since 1989, except for the case of Syria since 2011. As such, any country-year in which no events are recorded in the data were attributed zero deaths, except for Syria in this period.

Death rates are calculated using UN population figures.
