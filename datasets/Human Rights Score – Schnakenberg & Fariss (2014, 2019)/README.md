# Human Rights Score – Schnakenberg & Fariss (2014, 2019)

The dataset here was developed by Schnakenberg and Fariss (2014). The version of the dataset used here is v3.01 (Fariss, 2019). 

Schnakenberg and Fariss (2014) use data from the Cingranelli-Richards (CIRI) Human Rights Data Project to code several types of human rights abuses (e.g. disappearances, extrajudicial killing, political imprisonment, torture). They use an econometric model to aggregate these measures of abuse into a single number that we will here simply call the "Human Rights Score". This Score takes on values of around −3.8 to around 5.4 (where a higher Score indicates greater respect for human rights).
