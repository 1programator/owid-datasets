# Trust in Science and Health Professionals - Wellcome Trust (2019)

The Wellcome Global Monitor is the worldâ€™s largest study into how people around the world think and feel about science and major health challenges. It surveys over 140,000 people from more than 140 countries.

How much do you trust each of the following: other people in you neighbourhood; your national government; scientists; journalists; doctors and nurses; people who work at non-governmental or non-profit organizations; healers? Do you trust them a lot, some, not much, or not at all?

We then added the share of people who responded "a lot", and "some".
