# Forest land and change (FAO, 2020)

Raw data for forest area, deforestation, afforestation and expansion is sourced from the UN FAO Forest Resources Assessment.

Our World in Data have calculated several metrics based on this raw data including:
– Net change in forest area (afforestation minus deforestation)
– Net conversion rate (net change as a percentage of forest area)
– Each country's share of global forest area, deforestation, afforestation, and net change in forests
– Each country's share of regional forest area, deforestation, afforestation, and net change in forests
