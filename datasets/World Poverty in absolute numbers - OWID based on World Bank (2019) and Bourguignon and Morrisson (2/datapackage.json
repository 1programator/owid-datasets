All data from 1970 and earlier is taken from Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) – Inequality Among World Citizens: 1820–1992. In American Economic Review, 92, 4, 727–748. Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) state that 'the poverty lines were calibrated so that poverty and extreme poverty headcounts in 1992 coincided roughly with estimates from other sources’; here I rely on the midpoint of the two series published by Bourguignon and Morrison.",
