# Attainable yields (Mueller et al. 2012)

Attainable yields are defined as feasible crop yields based on high-yielding areas of similar climate. They are more conservative than biophysical ‘potential yields’, but are achievable using current technologies and management (e.g. fertilizers and irrigation).

Yield gaps have been calculated by Our World in Data as the difference between actual observed yields (as reported by the UN FAO: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/) and attainable yields, as reported by Mueller et al. (2012).
