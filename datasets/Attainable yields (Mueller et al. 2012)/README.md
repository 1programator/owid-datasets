# Attainable yields (Mueller et al. 2012)

Attainable yields are defined here as feasible crop yields based on outputs from high-yielding areas of similar climate. They are more conservative than absolute biophysical ‘potential yields’, but are achievable using current technologies and management (e.g. fertilizers and irrigation).
