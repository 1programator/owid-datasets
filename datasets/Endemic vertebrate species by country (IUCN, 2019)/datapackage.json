Endemic species are those which are known to naturally occur in only one country. \n\nAlso available is the number of these endemic species which are categorised as 'threatened'.  'Threatened' species are those in any of the three Red List categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable. They are considered high or greater risk of extinction in the wild.\n\nThis data is only given for the more comprehensively assessed species groups (i.e., where >80% of the species in the group have been assessed).",
